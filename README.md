# LDC Cleave Classifier & Tension Predictor

An AI-powered web app for analyzing fiber cleaves and predicting optimal tension settings to improve cleave quality.

---

## Project Overview

This web application allows engineers to upload cleave images from the **THORLABS LDC400** system. It performs two main tasks:

1.  **Classifies** the cleave as either **good** or **bad** using a CNN model.
2.  If the cleave is bad, it uses a **regression model** to predict the optimal **tension value** to improve the result.

The app is designed to be quick and easy for use in real lab settings.

---

## How It Works

- Upload a cleave image through the browser.
- Fill in metadata: cleave angle, scribe diameter, tension, misting, hackle, tearing
- The app uses a pre-trained image and feature model to classify the cleave.
- If the cleave is bad, the regression model recommends a better tension value.
- Feedback is shown on-screen immediately

---

## Features

-  Deep learning classification using **MobileNetV2** for transfer learning.
-  Dual-branch architecture: one for images, one for numerical parameters.
-  Tension prediction using a custom **regression model**.
-  Automatic image preprocessing including resizing and normalization.
-  Secure form input via **Flask-WTF** with CSRF protection.
-  Clean UI built with **Bootstrap 5**.

## What You Can Do

| Action               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Upload an image      | Submit a cleave photo from the THORLABS FCA system |
| Enter cleave data    | Provide angle, scribe diameter, tension, and binary labels for misting, hackle, and tearing |
| Get a quality result | The model tells you whether the cleave is good or bad |
| Predict new tension  | If bad, the app suggests a better tension value for performing cleave |
